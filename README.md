# Volcanic Eruptions
Analysis of the Volcanic Eruptions dataset from the Smithsonian Institution

In this project, we want to explore the various effects of volcanic activity on human activities and the natural world around it.  
Since volcano activities arenâ€™t man-made disasters, nor are they necessarily exacerbated by human activities, it would be interesting to see how it has affected humans, their actions and the natural world.  
Thus, the questions we want to answer are: 
* **Why do people still choose to live near active volcanoes?** 
* **How significant is the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions?**
